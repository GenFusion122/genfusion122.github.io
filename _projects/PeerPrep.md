### Description
Developed for the CS3219 (Software Engineering Principles and Patterns) Team Project.
PeerPrep is a Microservice-based Web Application that allows up to two programmers to collaborate on questions simultaneously. 

### Primary Features
- Question repository for users to answer
- Collaboration space for two programmers 
- Chat functionality between users
- Saving previous question attempts
- Matching making between users on certain criteria

### Techstack
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Web Framework**: ExpressJS
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: NodeJS
- **CI/CD**: Jasmine Test Framework, Supertest
- **Containerization**: Docker

### Highlights
PeerPrep was my first experience with a RESTful microservice architecture, through this project I experienced modern deployment strategies such as containerization through docker. A heavy emphasis was also placed on good Softare Engineering practices and Agile-based Development. This multifaceted experience honed my skills not just in technical aspects but also in fostering a cohesive, agile-driven team environment to develop this project efficiently.
