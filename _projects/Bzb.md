### Description
Developed for the NUS 2022 Summer [Orbital Program](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/). Apollo 11 (Advanced).

Mobile scheduling application built for `Android` using `Flutter` 

### Primary features
- Calendar Scheduling
- Task Entries
- Journal Entries
- Mood Predictor

### Techstack
- **Frontend/Backend**: Flutter
- **Database/Authentication System**: Firebase
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Tensorflow
- **CI/CD**: Codemagic
- **UI Planning**: Figma

### Highlights
First ever mobile application I have ever developed, no prior exprience to any components highlighted in the techstack. Had to learn quickly in order to meet the milestone deadlines set by the Orbital program while still developing enough features to remain competitive at the Apollo level.
