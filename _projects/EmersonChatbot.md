### Description
Developed during summer internship with Emerson Automation Solutions as part of their digital innovation initiative.
Entirely developed with Python, utilizing many common machine learning libraries like Sklearn and PyTorch. 
Supporting scripts to scrape data was also developed in order to create a viable data set. 

### Techstack
- **Language**: Python
- **Toolset**: Sklearn, Pandas, PyTorch
- **Models**: DistilBERTForSequenceClassification
- **Frontend**: Tkinter


### Highlights
This project marked my debut in Machine Learning as its central focus. Despite my initial unfamiliarity with Natural Language Processing, I rapidly acquired the skill to craft usable textual data from existing sources, meticulously shaping them into a viable chatbot dataset. Despite the challenges posed by the short duration of the internship, I persevered, and ended up with the creation of a simple yet impactful chatbot by the end.
