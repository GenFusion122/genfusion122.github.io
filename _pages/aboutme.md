# About Me
<div style="text-align: left">
I'm a passionate Software Developer, hoping to hone my skills through developing all manners of different projects. I'm driven by the challenge of exploring different software paradigms, leveraging them to build better applications that blend functionality with elegant design. Each project serves as an opportunity to enhance my expertise and contribute innovative solutions that elevate the standards of software development.
<p>
My academic journey is proof of my strong work ethic. Starting from ITE, I steadily progressed to one of NUS's most prestigious courses. It's a testament to my determination to keep improving, overcoming challenges to reach where I am today.
